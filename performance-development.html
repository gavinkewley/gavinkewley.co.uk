<h3>Performance Development</h3>
<p>Professional executive coaching can take two forms; either where an  individual comes to a coach for advice on work-related issues, or where a  company employs a professional to coach its employees in-house.</p>
<p class="maintext">Issues that a coach might address would include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">identifying and developing core competencies and interests</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">effective relationships with assistants/superiors/peers</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">developing improved leadership/management skills</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">developing conflict resolution skills</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">reviewing career path options</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">improving presentation skills</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">addressing work/life balance</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">increasing motivation</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">strategy planning</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">managing stress </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The emphasis is likely to be focused on work-related issues, but even so, an individual's personality, experiences and approach to life will play a big role in how they are performing at work and how they feel about their work life. Obviously, when a company is paying for executive coaching, the contract explicitly addresses expectations about client/coach confidentiality, the form and level of feedback to senior management and the parameters of coach accountability for outcomes.</p>
<p>Effective executive coaching facilitates improvements for the individuals involved and, when relevant, the companies that employ them. Through thoughtful, provocative coaching, people learn a lot about themselves which can help them get back in control, become more strategic and thus happier and more confident. A key route to being more effecctive in the workplace.</p>
<p>Whatever the challenges, there are always solutions. Develop the strategies that last and sustain your professional development.</p>
<p>Enhance your performance.</p>
