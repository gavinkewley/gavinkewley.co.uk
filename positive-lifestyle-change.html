<p class="maintext">Knowing what&rsquo;s right and actually doing it are two different things. We understand the benefits of adopting healthy lifestyle choices, for instance, losing weight, exercising, eating healthy foods, drinking in moderation and quitting smoking.&nbsp;&nbsp; Living a healthy, balanced life is a goal most of us aspire to. However, it is not always easy to make positive lifestyle changes and can be even harder to make them stick. If it were easy, there would be far fewer self-help groups, fad diets, addiction-beating aids and burgeoning gym memberships at the start of each year. <br /> <br /> So if you are trying to:<br /> <br /></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;"> Stick to a commitment you&rsquo;ve made to improve your lifestyle</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;"> Deal with a fear, habit or other recurrent problem area&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Identify ways to change your life for the better</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Overcome the effects of earlier poor health</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Improve your general health</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Lose weight</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="maintext"><br /> Effective life coaching could help you:<br /> <br /> Clarify your motivation for changing your life in positive ways<br /> Feel positive about taking up the challenge<br /> Realise why past attempts may have been unsuccessful<br /> Work out a practical strategy and timeline for change<br /> Recognise how to sustain long-term, lasting benefits<br /> <br /> I have noticed that long lasting and positive changes come about when we feel in control and happy about our choices. Rather than a pressured effort to achieve an outcome, I work with clients to have them identify what&rsquo;s really behind their desire for change and help them see their way forward.</p>
