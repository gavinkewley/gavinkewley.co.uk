<h3>What's it all about ?</h3>
<p>People deserve to feel happy, confident and fulfilled.</p>
<p><br /> As a professional coach, I help people sort through difficult issues and move forward in positive ways, privately and in confidence. Working with clients through listening, probing questions and thoughtful analysis, together we&nbsp; progress towards significantly greater clarity and a strategy for change.&nbsp; Some clients look for help tackling specific problems and making decisions, others are seeking more general support.</p>
<p>Clients bring a variety of issues, including:</p>
<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Personal development<br /> Decision-making<br /> Career change<br /> Work-life balance<br /> Stress management<br /> Interpersonal communication <br /> Time management<br /> Self-awareness and self-acceptance<br /> Presentation skills<br /> Relationships</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I meet with my personal coaching clients either in my office or in another place they are comfortable such as a local cafe, lounge, park, beach or other open space. For some, walking while talking helps open minds and generates more creative thinking, others prefer a quite space away from distractions. It's always your choice.</p>
<p>I usually meet with my business coaching clients in a confidential setting in their own organisation.&nbsp; Some corporate clients prefer to meet away from their work environment.&nbsp; Further details about logistics and my fees are an <a href="contact.html">email</a> away. I describe my background in <a href="who-is-gavin-kewley.html">more detail here</a>.</p>
<p>So, if you feel you could use help thinking through any kind of issues or if you are having trouble working out why life just isn't going quite right, then <a href="c">get in touch</a> and we can work together to get you ready, help you feel better and start to make the changes that do improve your life experiences.</p>
