<h3>AwayDays</h3>
<p>People who play together, stay together. Improve personal confidence, interpersonal relationships, team cohesiveness and communication skills by setting an out of the workplace challenge.</p>
<p>Working days: afloat in the Solent; on hills, moorland or mountains (with or without snow) are some of the best platforms to develop teams. Getting Coaching Afloat or at Altitude are high impact experiences.</p>
<p>Clarify and refine your management team's ethos and commitment, establish common beliefs and values, address workplace elephants or take time to get to know one another within a common yet totally different context. Trigger some of the most powerful learning and development you've ever had.</p>
<p>Reinforce achievement and performance by an awayday that yet further enahances their personal and team development and performance. <span style="color: #c0c0c0;">"We now have a clear idea as to how to improve what we do...and how we need to communicate differently....and I got to drive a 54' yacht. Fantastic!".</span> A Hogg Robinson delegate at the end of a one day Getting Coaching Afloat.</p>
