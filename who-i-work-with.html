<p class="maintext">Most of us wish to be fulfilled in our daily lives, adopt healthy lifestyle choices and have positive relationships around us. However, it is not always easy to make those positive changes and to make them stick or sometimes even to believe that it's possible.<br /> <br /> My clients say effective coaching helps you :</p>
<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Clarify your motivation for wanting change&nbsp; </span><br /><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Realise why, </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">so far, your efforts</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0;"> may not have been successful <br /></span><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Work out a practical strategy and timeline for change </span><br /><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Recognise how to sustain long-term, lasting benefits</span><br /><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">Feel more positive about taking up your challenge</span></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p class="maintext">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="maintext">Knowing what&rsquo;s right and actually doing it are two different things. Many clients have noticed that positive change comes about when they feel in control and happy about their choices. Rather than a pressured effort to achieve some outcome, I work with clients to help them identify what&rsquo;s really behind their desire for change and to see the way forward as a positive process.</p>
<p class="maintext"><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">"I can really see a way forward now. Things are so much lighter and </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">easier</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">."</span></p>
<p class="maintext">I work with people of all ages, both individuals and groups, at work, rest and play. Balance in each of these areas improves well being and greatly increases the likelihood of positive outcomes.</p>
