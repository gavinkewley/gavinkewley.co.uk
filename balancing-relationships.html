				<div id="mainText"><h2>Balancing Relationships</h2>
<p class="maintext">One of the most significant factors effecting good health and confidence is the quality of our interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p class="maintext">College, school, work or other responsibilities and pressures can seem to get in the way of building and sustaining quality friends and relationships. These can add to our stress or general unhappiness.</p>
<p class="maintext">Getting on with our parents, feeling able to trust friends, negotiating social time and keeping every body happy can be a big task. Youth coaching can help you think about what you really want. When we understand how the choices we make should always work with us in achieving what is really important to us, our own potential for positive changes emerges.</p>

<p class="maintext">Some people notice that how we feel about ourselves seems to impact on our ability to make and keep meaningful relationships. Being able to connect with other people feeling strong, confident and attractive makes a big difference. Not everyone believes that just being themselves is enough. Sensitive and empathetic life coaching can help you recognise yourself in different ways and seek opportunities to show yourself in a new, healthier, balanced and more productive light.</p>
<p><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">"Brilliant to meet up, I'm feeling much more positive as a result."</span></p>
<p class="maintext">Raise your chances of achieving what&rsquo;s important to you. Making a positive choice.</p>
