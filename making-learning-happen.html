<h3>"Be the best you can be"</h3>
<p>Sometimes getting it right is a real challenge?</p>
<p>Feeling that you could do better but not being sure how to start?</p>
<p>Working really hard yet still don't get the results that we'd like to?</p>
<p>I offer personal, confidential and positve coaching to help you find your own answers. I will not criticise or judge yet help you think through your challenge.</p>
<p>Making learning happen through coaching works for learners of any age. Together we will recognise your personal strengths and attributes, then build on them to create your own way of being the best they can be. Improve your grades, be happier, be more confident about learning and so get closer to being the best you can be.</p>
<p>Things to talk about could include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">identifying </span><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">your learning strengths and the best</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0;"> ways for you to improve your learning power<br /></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">choosing specific strategies to improve ; organisation, note taking, revision, coursework planning, time keeping &nbsp;or memory <br /></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">how you can motivate yourself and have greater drive and self-confidence to succeed</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">the effects of drinking water, nutrition, sleep and a positive learning environment </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">some new learning habits to develop, such as reflecting on your learning so as to build on it for next time</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">how to make sense of complex information</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #c0c0c0;">or anything else that you want to improve...<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="style18">The technical bit: 'Learning 2 Learn' is a process of discovery about learning. It involves a set of principles and skills which, when understood and used, help you learn more effectively. At its heart is the belief that learning is learnable. It draws on, and is indebted to, a wealth of thinking and practice from a range of disciplines. These include cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and formative assessment, assessment for learning, thinking skills, accelerated learning, emotional intelligence, the learning environment and health and nutrition for learning. Some of these influences have emerged from academic research, others from teachers in schools simply establishing what works or what feels right. I have contributed to this work locally, regionally and nationally.</p>
<p class="style18">I spend most of my time enabling people to be their best. I've be lucky enough to work with some of the most successful learners and some of the most switched off and challenging. Personal coaching has had a high impact on those who wish to do better yet maybe haven't found their way through their learning challenge yet.</p>
